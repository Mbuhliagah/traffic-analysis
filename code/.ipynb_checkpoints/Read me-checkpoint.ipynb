    "  - Import and read both datsets \n",
    "  - cleaned the datasets(delete an assosiated values, seprate columns, rename columns, and change type to the appropriate one)\n",
    "  - convert the Traffic Accidents and Casualties by Region dataset from long to wide using pd.pivot_table()\n",
    "  - join both datasets using 'outer' and inner for different analysis.\n",

    "### Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "applaying statstic and analysis to the combined dataset to find the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Which regions have the highest and lowest Driving Licenses based on years (1993 - 2017)\n",
    "* Which regions have the highest and lowest mean Traffic Accidents numbers for years (2016 - 2017)\n",
    "* The regions that have more Driving Licenses issued in each year than the year average.\n",
    "* The regions that have more Traffic Accidents happened in each year than the year average.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "* The investigation shows that Makkah region is one of the heighest in number of accidents which shows that this region is eathier not save to drive or the infastructor of the region is not good. I believe with more dataset include the infastructor of the region and the level of educations of the region population could show more resanoble reason for the high number.\n",
    "* Riyadh city was above average in issuing driving licienses \n",
    "* I would like to do this investgation with extra feature include gender of driving and level of education and use it with another Arab Gulf States\n",
